# SeeingEyeLog
This product is intended as a disability aid for people with time blindness. People with time blindness can use the Seeing Eye Log to increase their awareness of the last time they performed a non-routine hygiene task, or spoke to specific friends and family, or saw the sun like, really saw the sun.
